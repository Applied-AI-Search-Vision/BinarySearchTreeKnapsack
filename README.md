0-1 Knapsack Problem using Binary Tree Representation
Introduction
The 0-1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a knapsack so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

In this repository, we present an innovative approach to solving the 0-1 Knapsack problem using a binary tree representation. Each node in the tree represents an item, and the two children represent the decisions of including or excluding that item.

Algorithm Overview
Initialize a binary tree with the first item.
Traverse the tree and make decisions on including or excluding the current item.
Calculate the total value and weight for each decision.
Compare the solutions to find the optimal set of items to include in the knapsack.
